# Files Naming Convention
Since we will be downloading many concepts per class and using many search engines, a file naming
convention is crucial.

File Name : **N.SE.Q.Exp.i.ext**

        N : The order/rank of the keyword as provided by mykeyworder
       SE : The search engine used
        Q : The original query
      Exp : The expansion used
        I : The image order as returned from the search engine result
      ext : The file extension

Example: *1.google.Husky dog.puppy.198.jpeg*
